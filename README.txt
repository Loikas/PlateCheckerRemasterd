  === Plate Checker Remastered ===
 I haven't written this plugin and so all credit has to go to albo1125.
 This plugin contains the two police smart radio features I liked the most 
 before I had to uninstall traffic policer because of crash issues and I realized 
 that there aren't a lot of plugins with similar features so I decided to update 
 these two features.
 
  === Features ===
 Police Smart Radio's Plate Checker and Ped Checker 
 Each with their own keybinding.
 The plate checker works whenever you are looking at a car
 on foot or when you drive behind another vehicle while in your car
 The ped checker only works when you are on foot and looking at another person
 
  === BE AWARE ===
 Cars are only registered to the name of their driver if you scan the car while the
 driver is inside. Otherwise the car will be registered to a completely different person!
 
  === INSTALLATION ===
 Drag and drop the plugins file into your GTA V root file and everything should work fine
 To change the display name on notifications or the keybindings open the PlateCheckerRemastered.ini file!
 Standard keys are C for plate checking and X for ped checking

Thankyou for downloading and have fun!!
